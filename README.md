# Usave

## Personal Financial Management Mobile Application

Usave is a personal financial management mobile application designed to help users track their daily income, expenses, and savings. Users can set savings goals and monitor their progress over time. One of the standout features of Usave is its integration with the Google Gemini API, which provides personalized financial insights and daily notifications based on user transaction data. These AI-generated recommendations help users improve their financial management skills day by day.

Usave is built using **Flutter** with the **Dart** programming language. It utilizes **SQLite** for local data storage, ensuring maximum security for personal financial data as all information is stored directly on the userâ€™s device. Unlike cloud-based financial apps, Usave operates entirely offline, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. By storing financial data locally, users maintain full control over their sensitive information without the need for an internet connection. This makes Usave an ideal choice for individuals who prioritize privacy and data security while managing their finances efficiently.
